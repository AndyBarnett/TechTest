# CompareTheMarket Tech Test

##Java environment requirements
The Java Runtime Environment version can be jre7 or jre6.

## Importing the project
The project should be able to be run out-of-the-box. Import it into any IDE which can compile Java and run JUnit.

## Running the tests
The test runner is Unit. Execute the tests from within your IDE by running stepDefinitions/RunTests.java as a JUnit Test.

I have included the Chrome driver in the repo. The tests currently point to that due to the property set in Hooks.java.
